C++ nad Java codes with DSA logics

<!--Please ignore the `a.out` file as I do code in linux and G++ compiler produces `a.out` file everytime when my code gets compiled successfully.

## DSA `Data Structures and Algorithms` Concepts and other simple concepts are stored in different folders

## `cin.geltine()` is a method where we can take input from user including spaces and tabs

## getline functions have `3 parameters`

## `cin.getline(a, 10, '\n');`

      getline  |    |   |
    /**        |    |    |  Delimiter
     *      1st    2nd  3rd Parameter
     *   Parameter Parameter
         is var*/

## To take input in 2D array in Java

- Simple take a 2D variable as int and direct use this code
- import java.util.\*;
- int[][] arr = new int[[size]][size]
- Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
- arr[[i]][j] = scan.nextInt();
- This'll store numbers in array storage.
